# OOP-JAVA(DCIT 201 - Graded Assignment)
# Advanced Vehicle Rental Management System

## Assignment Objective
Design a comprehensive Vehicle Rental Management System that demonstrates **ALL** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Composition

## Problem Domain: Vehicle Rental Management System

### Core Requirements



### Specific Implementation Guidelines

#### Encapsulation Requirements
- All fields must be private
- Use constructor/setter validation
- Provide controlled access through methods

#### Inheritance Requirements
- Create a meaningful inheritance hierarchy
- Use `super()` for parent class initialization
- Override `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`

#### Polymorphism Requirements
- Implement method overriding
- Use interfaces for flexible design
- Create methods that accept base class/interface types

#### Abstraction Requirements
- Use abstract classes and interfaces
- Hide complex implementation details
- Provide clean, intuitive public interfaces

### Testing Requirements
1. Unit test each class independently
2. Test all possible scenarios
3. Validate encapsulation
4. Check inheritance and polymorphic behavior
5. Verify abstraction implementations

### Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of OOP principles
- Code quality and readability
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Innovative solution design
- Error handling and validation

### Submission Guidelines
1. Create a well-structured Maven/Gradle project
2. Use meaningful package structure
3. Include comprehensive unit tests
4. Write clean, documented code
5. Follow Java naming conventions

## Recommended Tools
- JDK 11+
- Maven/Gradle
- JUnit 5
- Mockito (optional)

## Grading Rubric
- OOP Principles Implementation: 20%
- Code Quality: 5%
- Testing Coverage: 5%
- Design Creativity: 5%
- Documentation: 5%

Good luck, and happy coding-Joe!
